Macro Name: `{{user.status.mass}}`

# What It Does

This macro checks:

- Your contributor **Mass**
- Whether the Fog has started **reinforcing** your Mass -- practicing
- Where your influence is showing up

It’s scoped **only to you**.

This macro will use your name automatically if:

- You’ve set a nickname in settings (under “What should ChatGPT call you?”), **OR**
- You’ve set a nickname with Chat during a session:
  _“Call me [nickname]”_
  _(That gets saved automatically.)_

If no name is set, it will use **“you”** or a structural placeholder.
